chargify-scala
==============

This is a Scala/Java binding for the Chargify API services.

Scala makes no guarantees of binary compatibility of compiled modules
with subsequent versions of Scala.  So it is essential that you
bundle the same jars used for compilation.  As of this writing,
chargify-scala is compiled against Scala 2.8.0 and Lift 2.1, and
these dependencies are:

  scala-library-2.8.0.jar
  lift-common_2.8.0-2.1.jar
  lift-util_2.8.0-2.1.jar
  lift-actor_2.8.0-2.1.jar


Notes for use from Java:
------------------------

chargify-scala is trivially used from Java code.  You should be
aware of some quirks.

  * Scala's class libraries do not use the Java libraries, although
    it does provide equivalents with similar names.  For example,
    several of the methods return lists of items, with type
    scala.collection.immutable.List.  The instances of this list
    can be iterated by requesting the list's iterator, which has
    a similar protocol to java.util.Iterator.

  * Many of chargify-scala's methods follow the Scala practice of
    using Option[A] to pass optional parameters.  In Scala, you
    pass an instance of 'None' for no parameter.  This instance
    cannot be directly obtained from Java, but an instance is
    provided in the static field 'none' on
    com.introspectrum.chargify.Preamble.
